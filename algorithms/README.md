## Algorithms Module
Module containing machine learning and AI algorithms that are separate from models.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (knn.py)
Contains a class for predicting class labels or target values using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm.

Details:
- **KNearestNeighbor**: Class containing functions for predicting class labels or target values.
  - predict: Predicts class labels for the test data after training on the training data.
  - regression: Predicts target values for the test data after training on the training data.
  - find_optimal_k: Finds the best K value using cross-validation on the dataset.
